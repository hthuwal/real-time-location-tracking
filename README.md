# The Task
- Localization of mobile devices based on probe requests received at Access points
- Long Term Goal - Simultaneous localisation of multiple devices, for analytics
- Probe requests - Any wifi enabled device sends frame requesting information regarding  all access points in the area
- Each probe request contains: MAC id of the device, timestamp, signal strength
- Not necessary for the mobile device to be connected to AP. Only wifi scanning should be on
